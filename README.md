<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## Project Abstract


- This project aims to develop an iOT and Mobile integrated NFC bus pass system for Indian Metropolitan Cities like Pune, which will address the current limitations of the paper-based bus pass system. The proposed solution will provide users with a more convenient and environmentally friendly way of using the bus transit system.

- The current paper-based bus pass system has many limitations. Firstly, users often lose their passes, which leads to additional costs and waste of resources. Secondly, the paper-based system does not offer the flexibility of renewing passes from anywhere, as users must physically visit designated centers to renew their passes. Finally, the lack of an eticketing system and daily/tourist pass options limits the convenience of using the bus transit system.

- The proposed solution aims to address these limitations by developing iOT and Mobile integrated NFC bus passes/cards. These passes will allow users to renew their passes from anywhere using their NFC-enabled smartphones. Additionally, users who do not have NFC-enabled smartphones can use NFC cards/tags as new bus passes. This solution will provide users with more flexibility and convenience in using the bus transit system.

- The proposed solution aligns with the United Nations SDGs, specifically SDG 11: Sustainable Cities and Communities. By providing a more sustainable and efficient bus transit system, this project aims to contribute towards the development of sustainable cities and communities. The project also supports SDG 13: Climate Action by reducing the amount of paper waste generated by the current system. Finally, the project aligns with SDG 7: Affordable and Clean Energy by promoting the use of iOT technology, which can lead to more efficient and sustainable energy consumption.
